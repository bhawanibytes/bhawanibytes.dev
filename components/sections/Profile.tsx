      <p>
        My core strength lies in backend development, with experience across the
        full stack when required. I value performance, clarity, and writing
        maintainable code.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I’m not coding, I’m usually exploring new technologies or diving
        into movies and science.

      <p>Open to freelance and full-time opportunities.</p>
